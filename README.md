# 🛡️ ThreatLens

### AI-Powered Penetration Testing & Threat Intelligence Platform

_"Security is never a product, it's a continuous process. Let's build that process smarter."_ 🔐

---

## 🌍 Overview

**ThreatLens** is a full-stack web platform designed to simulate real-world cyber attacks, detect anomalies in system logs using artificial intelligence, and help users identify security weaknesses in a visual, interactive format.

Built with a blend of **penetration testing tools**, **AI-powered analysis**, and a clean **frontend dashboard**, the project showcases advanced coding practices, professional structure, and a strong focus on both **security** and **usability**.

---

## 🎯 Project Aim

To provide a hands-on, automated platform for:

- Simulating penetration attacks on web applications and networks
- Analysing logs and traffic using AI/ML techniques
- Educating developers and testers on common vulnerabilities and threat patterns
- Demonstrating secure, modular, and scalable software architecture

---

## 🎓 Expected Outcome

This project aims to:

- Provide realistic, explainable threat analysis using **machine learning**
- Serve as a **portfolio piece** for cybersecurity and AI-focused roles
- Illustrate professional coding practices, test coverage, DevOps workflows, and frontend/backend integration
- Offer **real-world learning value** to testers, developers, and security analysts

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer              | Tools / Languages                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**       | React.js, Tailwind CSS                   |
| **Backend**        | Python (Flask or FastAPI), REST API      |
| **AI Module**      | Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas |
| **Pentest Engine** | Python scripts (SQLi, XSS, brute force)  |
| **Database**       | PostgreSQL or MongoDB                    |
| **DevOps**         | Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD            |
| **Security Tools** | OWASP ZAP, sqlmap, nmap, Burp Suite      |

## 🖥️ Application Features

### 🔧 Automated Penetration Testing

- Simulates SQL injection, XSS, brute force and more
- Uses custom Python scripts or integrations with existing tools
- Captures response data for analysis

### 🧠 AI-Powered Threat Detection

- Parses logs using NLP and anomaly detection models
- Classifies events into categories like _Reconnaissance_, _Exploitation_, _Post-exploitation_
- Trained with custom datasets for threat pattern recognition

### 🌐 Interactive Dashboard

- Clean UI for monitoring active scans and AI predictions
- Includes visual charts, status alerts, and audit logs
- Accessible login system with role-based permissions

### 🛠️ Developer-Ready Architecture

- Modular folder structure with scalable services
- Fully containerised with Docker
- Unit tested, linted, and CI/CD ready

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User logs in** via secure authentication (JWT)
2. **Selects a pentest scenario** from dashboard (e.g. Brute Force on Login Page)
3. **Scan is launched** via backend Python script
4. **Log data is captured** and fed into AI model
5. **AI classifies risk** and displays output in real time
6. **User views results** and can download a security report
